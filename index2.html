          <strong>Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.</strong>

          <strong>While this assumption might be partially true, it's still possible that some of these features remain a mystery to some devs.

            One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration. The question is, what makes them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you.
            
            In this article, we'll discuss var, let and const  with respect to their scope, use, and hoisting. As you read, take note of the differences between them that I'll point out.</strong>

          <strong>Okay so yeah we know they are different they have different purpose and goals still we don’t bother to understand them.

            Let’s get straight to them.
            
            We use arrays. A lot of arrays. We use arrays to show search lists, items added into a user cart, How many time you logged into your system right ?
            
            Javascript Array inbuilt object provides some really cool and helpful functions to manage our data stored in arrays. We are going to take a look on this methods really quick.
            
            Let’s start with the easy one.</strong>
